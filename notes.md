could not clone repo from zmuda44 for some reason.  i am able to clone repos from this greg-bailey-p account perfectly fine.

logic behind this.

83: click on the button and run trackEmployeeData

60 trackEmployeeData is a function that says:
console.table(collectEmployees function on line 5)

(a fucntion you create)displayAverageSalary(also collectEmployees)







The areas that you work with:
collectEmployees

displayAverageSalary(takes employeesArray as a parameter)

getRandomEmployee(takes employeesArray as a parameter)
